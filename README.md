# Musico
A really fun music bot made by [AAAGAMERx Playz](https://youtube.com/channel/UCalWfJoti4ZojDE9W7oqYNQ)

# Prefix
The default prefix of Musico is `m!` but it can be changed.


# Installing Or Running The Bot:
Such a simple bot setup. Its just 3 steps. 
```
Step 1: Go to config.js and change the TOKEN and PREFIX to your bot token and prefix respectively.
Step 2: Run the bot.
Step 3: BOOM the bot is working.
```
See simple right. Easy.

The config.js looks like this:
```
{
  "TOKEN": "INSERT_YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE",
  "PREFIX": "INSERT_YOUR_BOT_PREFIX_HERE:,
  "approveemoji": "‚úÖ", //DO Not Change This.
  "denyemoji": "üö´", //Do Not Change This
  "erroremoji": "Ô∏è‚ùó" //Do Not Change This
}
```

# NOTE:

You can run the bot BUT you CANNOT EDIT ANYTHING OF IT.
If you are making a video of it, make sure to give me credit.
Contributions are always welcome.

# Common Errors:
While using `m!lyrics` command and `m!nowplaying` command, you get "There is no lyrics for the song" and "There was an error executing that command" error respectively. It is because of either codeing error or api error (IDK). This is being fixed.
